#All programs are assignments for CS101 Fall 2018 Class.
#The assignment number and descriptions are below:
#Program 3 (checker): 


#Program 4 (websweep): 


#Program 5 (sunspots): You are provided an input file called sunspots.csv.  This is a comma separated value file.  
#The first value is the year, then the month, then day.  The 4th value is a decimal form of the year, which we donâ€™t need.  
#The 5th value is the number of sunspots observed.  
#A -1 indicates no observation and will be assumed as zero for our purposes, there may also be non-numeric characters in the field, 
#which can also be counted as zero. ( elegantly handle the exceptions )  The 6th column will not be used.  
#You can use the .csv module for reading through the file.  Your program will output 2 files, one is the monthly sunspots totaled.  
#The other will be the smoothed sunspots per month.
